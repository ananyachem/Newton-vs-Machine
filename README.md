This project involved building a neural network to predict trajectories of the three bodies in the three-body problem. 

### What is the three-body problem?
Unless the starting positions and velocities of the three bodies are known, it is impossible to predict their trajectories owing to the chaotic nature of the three-body problem.

All the hyper parameters in this code was sourced from the paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.07291
